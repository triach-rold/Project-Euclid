### Without specific documentation 

- **Euclidean GCD** -> A method to calculate the [Greatest Common Divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of two numbers using [Euclid's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm).
- **nCr Operator** -> A method to calculate the [Combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) of two numbers using the definition.
- **Newton's Square Root** -> A method to calculate the [square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root) of a number using [Newton's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).

### With Specific Documentation

- **Anagram** -> Finds all possible anagrams for a given word. Use `--custom-dictionary filename.txt` for special comparisons to a custom dictionary (it chooses dictionary.txt by default).
- **Numerical Integral** -> Parses an expression and calculates the area under the curve for the parsed function by reimann sums, trapezoid sums, and simpsons rules.
- **Newton's Root Finder** -> Parses an expression and calculates the root of the parsed function by iterating guesses based on newton's rule.
